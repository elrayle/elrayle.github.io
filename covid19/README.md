This site is tracking the COVID19 outbreak in and around Cortland County, New York.  The graphs show cummulative confirmed cases based on data from the following sources.

* [Johns Hopkins CCSEGISandData](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData) - Used for World and US numbers.
* [Johns Hopkins map](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html?fbclid=IwAR10wt9a2d778FvxQ1MOg_qw5aL80ypVBRVkb-ouk233xEQxuXC6c9XHSGY#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) - This is used for  World and US numbers at the time the NY numbers are recorded for the current day.  The World and US numbers are updated to the [csse_covid_19_daily_reports](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports) numbers once they are available.
* [New York County by County Breakdown of Positive Cases](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/county-county-breakdown-positive-cases) - Used for NY state and county numbers.  The numbers are recorded once per day in the late afternoon.
* [New York Times map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#us) - This is used for a rough estimate of the first few days of the outbreak in Cortland County and surrounding areas.

*Disclaimer: The graphs are provided without a guarantee that they are up to date at the moment of display as outside pressures could prevent updates.  My general process is to update the graphs once per day.  Please get information from multiple sources.  I am maintaining this in my spare time primarily for my own use.  I thought others may find this helpful as well, so I am putting it in a space that is more broadly available.*
